            Steve Jobs was an American entrepreneur, computer designer and businessman. 

         Born in 1955 in San Francisco to Syrian and Swiss-German parents, Steve Jobs was adopted by Paul Jobs, a machinist and veteran of the Coast Guard, and his wife Clara Jobs, an accountant. When Jobs was 6 years old, they moved to a town near Palo Alto, California, where silicon was in the air and the electronic industry was just beginning to buzz.</p>
            <p id="me2">During his childhood, Jobs was less interested in group sports and activities and more interested in gadgets and electronics.

            In 1972, he went to Portland, Oregon, to attend Reed College. Two years later, he took a job with Atari, designing videogames. After only one semester at Reed, Jobs dropped out and left his job at Atari to spend a summer traveling around India studying their many religions across India.</p>
